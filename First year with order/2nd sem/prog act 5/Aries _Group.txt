as per instruction, less than 7 is allowed. I took the liberty to solo the project; not because I believe that I can but because
I believe I need this mental exercise to challenge myself in order to improve.

All my classmates are either interesting, hella-smart, has advanced read in programming, and many more good things(some of them
already have jobs in programming). I took this chance to somehow atleast catch up with them.

So please allow this one time big time "solo group."
